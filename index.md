# Google Summer of Code 2019

This is a brief summary of the project ideas for the Google Summer of Code 2019
within the NethServer project.

## Modules for schools and more

NethServer is a modular Linux distribution based on CentOS. It can run many
applications together, easily installed and configured with just one click from
its web administration interface.

You can learn how to create and maintain a module for NethServer, integrating an
application like **Mattermost**, **Moodle** or **Savapage**, and building its
RPMs with TravisCI.org.

## Web administration interface programming

We are porting the NethServer web administration interface (named "Server
Manager") to a new UI framework based on the **Cockpit** project and designed
according to **Patternfly** rules.

You will learn how to design a Web-UI page with **Vue.js** and how to invoke
the underlying system APIs that configure the system.

## Explore Linux containers solutions

Linux distributions are changing the way they provide software to the end user,
striving for stability, security and being at the latest version.  Linux
containers are a possible solution to integrate on the same system otherwise
incompatible software stacks.

You will explore the new tools like **Buildah** and **Podman** to run a program
in a Linux container and search for solutions to integrate it with the
other NethServer modules.

## Infrastructure and data collection analysis

The NethServer community has an evolving infrastructure of web sites that
distribute RPMs and documentation and collect systems usage data.

You will endeavor to integrate the **Pulp 3** project in our infrastructure, to 
distribute RPMs to the community mirrors.
